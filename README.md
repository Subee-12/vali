# 💕 Valentine's Day Game for My Princess

An interactive Valentine's Day game created for My Princess — the sweetest question, with a playful dodge and a shy teddy surprise!

## 🎮 How It Works

- My Princess receives a link to this interactive game
- She sees the question: **"Will you be my Valentine, My Princess?"**
- Option 1: Click **"Yes, My Princess!"** and she'll see a shy teddy reveal with confetti! 🎁✨
- Option 2: Click **"No, My Princess"** and the button will playfully dodge away from the cursor 😄
